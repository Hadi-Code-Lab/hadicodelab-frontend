## Hadi Code Lab

Welcome to the "Hadi Code Lab" repository where you can find how I created the client side of this project.

## Why this project started

It's been a while that I wanted to create a new project. So, I was wondering how I can make something that will help me to introduce myself besides helping other developers to learn what I have learned through these years. The idea came to my mind that it can be such a creative thing to have both portfolio and blog. Therefore, I began to do everything by myself.

## My responsibilities at this project

1- Front-end development
<br/>
2- Backend-end development
<br/>
3- UI/UX design
<br/>
4- Database design and management
<br/>

All by myself

## Project management

I'll be doing it through the scrum framework that is why I'll be using Jira software.
